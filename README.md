# Bootstrap-Portfolio


# Installation
Download the file from github, then add it to a folder where you can open it by using VS (visual sutdio code),


# General Info
I created my own portfolio using bootstrap, html and css. For this project I used my old portfolio as an example to copy.
This portfolio is enriched with a navigation bar that has a hover in it, and also on a smaller screen, all navigation seletros are hidden in a small icon which, when pressed, will reveal a menu with selectors.
This task was to learn how to create a more professional website that is more interactive with people who visit my website and also adapted to different screens.
